        - Rework combat system by added an events based system.
            - Will need an event dispatcher
            - Do clients send events or does the Game listen for them and then dispatch other events accordingly?
                -I.e, How do we dispatch and receive player attacks etc
            - check valid attack on client(the sword hits or something), send our attack request to event manager,
              manager processes checks validity and sends the event to the other client
        - Transition into 2D Scroller.
